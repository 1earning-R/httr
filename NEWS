httr 0.2.99
-------------

* Added default user agent which includes versions of Curl, RCurl and httr.

* Switched to RJSONIO from rjson. No longer loads onto search path.

* Add support for handling the OAuth2 dance without running a local webserver.
  Contributed by Craig Citro. (#33)

* Add support for passing oauth2 tokens in headers instead of the URL, and
  make this the default. Contributed by Craig Citro. (#34)

* `stop_for_status()` now raises errors with useful classes so that you can
  use `tryCatch()` to take different actions depending on the type of error.
  See `http_condition()` for more details.

* httr now imports the methods package so that it works when called with
  Rscript.
  
* New automatic parsers for mime types `text/tab-separated-values` and 
  `text/csv` (#49)

* Urls with missing query param values (e.g. `http://x.com/?q=`) are now
  parsed correctly (#27). The names of query params are now also escaped
  and unescaped correctly when parsing and building urls.

* `oauth2.0_token()` uses option `httr_oob_default` to determine whether 
  or not to use `oob` authentication by default. This is useful to set when
  running R remotely.

* Use the httpuv webserver for the OAuth dance (instead of the built-in 
  httpd server). This makes the dance work in Rstudio, and also seems a little
  faster. (#32, thanks to @jdeboer)

httr 0.2
-----------

* OAuth now uses custom escaping function which is guaranteed to work on all
  platforms (Fixes #21)

* When concatenating configs, concatenate all the headers. (Fixes #19)

* export `hmac_sha1` since so many authentication protocols need this

* `content` will automatically guess what type of output (parsed, text or raw)
  based on the content-type header. It also automatically converts text
  content to UTF-8 (using the charset in the media type) and can guess at mime
  type from extension if server doesn't supply one. Media type and encoding
  can be overridden with the `type` and `encoding` arguments respectively.

* response objects automatically print content type to aid debugging.

* `text_content` has become `context(, "text")` and `parsed_content`
  `content(, "parsed")`. The previous calls are deprecated and will be removed
  in a future version.

* In `oauth_listener`, use existing httpd port if help server has already been
  started. This allows the ouath authentication dance to work if you're in
  RStudio. (Fixes #15).

* add several functions related to checking the status of an http request.
  Those are : `status`, `url_ok` and `url_success` as well as
  `stop_for_status` and `warn_for_status`.

* `build_url`: correctly add params back into full url.

httr 0.1.1
----------

* Add new default config: use the standard SSL certificate

* Add recommendation to use custom handles with `authenticate`
