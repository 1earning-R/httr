* In `oauth_listener`, use existing httpd port if help server has already been
  started. This allows the ouath authentication dance to work if you're in
  RStudio. (Fixes #15).

* add several functions related to checking the status of an http request.
  Those are : `status`, `url_ok` and `url_success` as well as `stop_for_status`
  and `warn_for_status`.

* `build_url`: correctly add params back into full url.
