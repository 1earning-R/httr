Title: Tools for working with URLs and HTTP
Version: 0.1
Author: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Maintainer: Hadley Wickham <h.wickham@gmail.com>
Description: Provides useful tools for working with HTTP connections.  Is a 
  simplified wrapper built on top of RCurl.  It is much much less configurable
  but because it only attempts to encompass the most common operations it is
  also much much simpler.
Depends:
    RCurl,
    stringr
Suggests:
    rjson,
    XML
