# httr

The aim of httr is to provide a user-friendly wrapper for RCurl that is less configurable but well suited to the demands of modern web APIs. It is inspired by modern http libraries in other languages

Inspirations:

* [Resty](http://beders.github.com/Resty/Resty/Examples.html)
* [httparty]http://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty/tree/master
